Hello! My name is Jo√£o Matos and I am a software developer from [Lisbon, Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon).

I work at [Xamarin](xamarin.com) on the runtime team, where I have the opportunity to contribute to the fanstatic [Mono](http://mono-project.com/) runtime, class libraries and [CppSharp](https://github.com/mono/CppSharp) projects.

Previously I've also worked at [Pathscale](http://www.pathscale.com/) contributing to the [LLVM](http://llvm.org/) and [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org/) projects.

My main interests in software development are languages, compilers, runtimes, 3D graphics and game engines.

I can also be seen pretending to be a musician and dabble into different things, from accoustic and electric guitars, bass, pianos and singing.

Other hobbies I have are freshwater planted tanks / fishkeeping, diving and R/C.

This is my website where I'll be posting about my projects and random thoughts.

Feel free to contact me if you'd just like to say hi.
